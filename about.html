      <p>
        The automation of important aspects of scientific discovery will
        significantly accelerate. Our claim is that given the right knowledge
        and methods, computers could autonomously carry out discovery processes
        by searching hypothesis spaces in a systematic, comprehensive, and
        efficient manner.<br /><br />
        In this project, we are investigating a novel approach to automate the
        hypothesize-test-evaluate discovery cycle with an intelligent system
        that a scientist can task with lines of inquiry to test hypotheses of
        interest. We are implementing this approach in DISK (automated DIscovery
        of Scientific Knowledge), a system that uses the existing WINGS
        intelligent workflow system for scientific data analysis, and applying
        it to multiple domains.<br /><br />
        Our work to date has focused on four major research objectives:
      </p>

      <p>
        1) Representing hypotheses and associated evidence and confidence
        values;
      </p>

      <p>
        2) Formulating lines of inquiry that express how to test hypotheses by
        running data analysis workflows against the latest data available;
      </p>

      <p>
        3) Designing a meta-analysis engine that uses meta-workflows to assess
        the results of lines of inquiry and revise and extend the original
        hypotheses accordingly; and
      </p>

      <p>
        4) Developing intelligent agents for interactive discovery that explain
        new findings to scientists.

      <p>
        An overview of the DISK framework can be seen in the image above,
        illustrating how the four main objectives are integrated. First, a user
        defines the hypothesis to test with the help of the interactive
        discovery agent, which helps to transform the hypothesis statements into
        a machine readable representation.
        If the hypothesis matches a line of inquiry, then the system will start searching for the appropriate data
        to test it, exploring open repositories for each specific domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the data is found, the workflows in the line of inquiry are sent to
        the workflow system, where they are executed. The results of the
        execution are then stored in the DISK system and can be used for posterior analysis.
        Finally, the repository and previous results are explored by the metaworkflows associated with the line of
        inquiry to create a revision of the original hypothesis.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h4> Representing hypotheses </h4>
      <p>
        To represent hypotheses and goals we use the Scientific Question Ontology (SQO).
        SQO aims  to define Semantic Templates for Scientific Questions, in order to make them customizable by users.
        This ontology defines Question Templates, Question Variables and their respective options and constraints.
        This way users are guided on the creation of testable hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest version of the ontology is available at <a href="https://w3id.org/sqo" target="_blank">w3id.org/sqo</a>
